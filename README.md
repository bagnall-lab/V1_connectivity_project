# V1_connectivity_project

#### The jupyter script (V1_Manuscript_Model_and_Figures.ipynb) should allow you to simulate the model for all local connectivity and gives you directions for how to change V1 network structure.

#### This project also contains the scripts used to create the figures in the manuscript. 

#### The folders contain data from 15 simulations for the different configurations of the network described in the manuscript.
